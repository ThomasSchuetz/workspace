This project is just a small workspace I use for experimenting.

Most of the code is written in Python and may be used within other open-source repositories.

More serious projects that I have contributed to can be found here: https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/BuildingOPT ; https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/BESopt
